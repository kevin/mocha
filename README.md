A modular Java neural network implementation.

Using objects to represent a neural network, meant to be easy to understand <sub>(for me)</sub>.

Custom learning algorithms can be implemented for various techniques with the data such as curriculum learning or stochastic gradient descent, with a standard gradient descent being included at the moment.

Written mostly to help me understand the math behind training a neural network as well as practice git and library design with objects and inheritance.
